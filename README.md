For this page I used Sass(Scss), JavaScript, DOM, HTML, Photoshop, Responsive design.
Page is about music app, with effect on images (About), with steps for downloading app (Using Photoshop to create mobile phone with name and image from the beginning of the page, and with images of buttons for Google Store and AppStore. In part of the page for Get app, cards are rotating to display buttons.
Page is responsive, and for smaller device, navigation changes showing button to display navigation (button is fixed). In this project I used grid, animation examples (with transform).
